This a UWP created for the msp program. The application's purpose is to test your reaction time. 
Once the color goes red you need to tap as fast as possible.
Your reaction time is then revealed based on how long it took you to tap the screen.
If you tap before the red screen appears it doesn't count as reaction time.
